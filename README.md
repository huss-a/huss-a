#  About Me 😁

Hello! My name is Hussain, and my goal is to become a Full Stack Web Developer. I started learning Programming with Python, I learned how to make a discord bot in late October 2020, and I absuloutely loved it. Since then, I've moved on to Web Development and I couldn't be happier 😊

I'm currently working on a React Website to gain more expierience with the framework.

### Here's my Skillset:
* Python
* C#
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (Incl. ES6+ Syntax, React JS w/ Next.js)
* NodeJS (Inlc. Express)
* MongoDB (w/ Mongoose)

### My Goals for 2021:
* Get Really good at React JS, Express and C#
* Learn React Native
* ~~Learn Next.js~~
* Learn PostgreSQL
* Learn TypeScript
* Learn GraphQL

and many other things!

Besides being a Web Dev, I am also an avid Aviation Enthusiast. I love Flight Simulators, going Plane Spotting etc. 🤩
My Favourite Aircraft is the Airbus A350 Series 😁
