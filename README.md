#  About Me 😁

Hello! My name is Hussain, and my goal is to become a Full Stack Web Developer. I started learning Programming with Python, I learned how to make a discord bot in late October 2020, and I absuloutely loved it. Since then, I've moved on to Web Development and I couldn't be happier 😊

The usual development environment I work in is the Windows Subsystem For Linux (WSL 2), with Ubuntu

### Here's my Skillset:
* Python
* C#
* HTML5, CSS3
* JavaScript (w/ React)
* TypeScript
* NodeJS (Incl. Express)
* MongoDB (w/ Mongoose in Node and pymongo in Python)
* PostgreSQL
* TypeORM
* Dart & Flutter
* Docker

Besides being a Web Dev, I am also an avid Aviation Enthusiast. I love Flight Simulators, going Plane Spotting etc. 🤩
My Favourite Aircraft is the Airbus A350 Series 😁

My Pronouns are he/him
